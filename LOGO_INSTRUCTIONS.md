# Instructions for Adding the Real BT Repair Centre Logo

## Steps to add the real PNG logo:

1. **Save the logo image**:
   - Right-click on the BT Repair Centre logo image you have
   - Save it as "bt-repair-centre-logo.png"
   - Place it in the folder: `/Users/kiwana/Desktop/BT QUEUE SYSTEM/public/images/`

2. **The code is already updated**:
   - Header component now references `/images/bt-repair-centre-logo.png`
   - Added `object-contain` class for better image scaling
   - Logo will display at 32x32 pixels (w-8 h-8)

3. **File path should be**:
   ```
   /Users/kiwana/Desktop/BT QUEUE SYSTEM/public/images/bt-repair-centre-logo.png
   ```

4. **Alternative sizes** (if needed):
   - You can also save multiple sizes: bt-repair-centre-logo@2x.png (64x64)
   - Or save as bt-repair-centre-logo.jpg if PNG is too large

Once you save the PNG file in the correct location, the logo will automatically appear in the header!
